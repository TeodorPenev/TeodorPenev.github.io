              <br/>Several hundred years ago, humans were nearly exterminated by titans. Titans are typically several stories tall, seem to have no intelligence, devour human beings and, worst of all, seem to do it for the pleasure rather than as a food source. A small percentage of humanity survived by building a city protected by extremely high walls, even taller than the largest of titans.<br/><br/>Flash forward to the present and the city has not seen a titan in over 100 years, until one day, a Colossal Titan appears out of thin air and destroys part of the city wall. As teenage boy Eren Jaegar and his foster sister Mikasa Ackerman witness the destruction of their town and death of their mother at the hands of the titans, Eren vows to kill every single titan and take revenge for all of mankind.</div>

Despite the city being safe and peaceful, young Eren Yeager wishes to see the outside world by joining the Recon Corps, a group of soldiers that venture outside and fight Titans, as he sees living in the city forever like trapped cattle. Despite his foster sister Mikasa Ackerman and their mother Carla are against him in joining the Corps and even after seeing the Recon Corps returning home with large casualties, Eren stills wants to join them which impresses his father Grisha. After Eren and Mikasa save their friend Armin Arlelt from bullies due to his views that the walls won't protect them forever, a colossal Titan much higher than the walls suddenly appears and kicks the Shiganshina gate, allowing smaller Titans to enter. As the people run away from the Titans, Eren and Mikasa head to their home to save their mother as she is trapped under their collapsed house by the debris falling from the wall. Despite Carla begging her children to leave her and save themselves, they refuse and it is only after City Guard Hannes arrives and takes the children away against their wishes. Eren and Mikasa watch in horror as a Titan kills and eats their mother.</div>

The people of Shiganshina escape to Wall Maria, the city's outer wall while the soldiers try to hold off the Titans. Fearing the Titans might breach into Wall Maria, the soldiers order the gate to Wall Maria close despite Hannes protest that there are still people outside. However, a giant armored Titan rams into the gate, allowing the Titans to enter the lands of Wall Maria. As a result of the breach, the government orders all survivors from Wall Maria to evacuate into Wall Rose. Eren has a strange dream that his grieving father forcefully giving him an injection and his key before being waked up by Mikasa. Eren grows disgusted with the people of Wall Rose as the latter don't like giving their food to the refugees. But the next year, with not enough food to feed the people, the government orders the refugees to work at the farms or fight reclaiming Wall Maria which results in many deaths including Armin's grandfather. Eren vows revenge for what the Titans did and wants to kill them by joining the Army with Mikasa and Armin joining as well. A year later, Eren, Mikasa, Armin and many young recruits begin their training.</div>

When Sasha Browse is caught eating a potato during the drill, she is punished to run around the camp until exhaustion. She is later taken back to bed by Ymir and Christa Renz. Eren has a rivalry with Jean Kirschtein, as the latter wants to join the Military Police because their only job is to protect the inner city walls, whom Eren finds cowardly. The recruits begin training using 3D Maneuver Gear by maintaining their balance in the air. Eren has trouble balancing his Gear, so he asks Reiner Braun and Bertholt Fubar for help. As Reiner and Bertholt give advice to Eren, the three of them, including Armin, head to a nearby lake. Both reveal that they came from a town that was not warned of the Titans' attack. Despite surviving, Reiner wants to go back to their hometown. Bertholt, on the other hand, was traumatized by the Titans and wants to join the police to avoid and encounter with them. The next day, Eren tries the Maneuver Gear again and succeeds for a while before falling once more. Much to everyone's surprise, Keith discovers that Eren's Gear was actually defective and after equipping another recruit's working Gear, he proves to indeed have the aptitude to use it. The fact that Eren could maintain his balance even for a few seconds with a faulty Gear impresses Keith and the other recruits. Proud of the recruits who succeeded, Keith further continues their training with the Maneuver Gear.</div>

Despite Jean and some of his friends claim that confronting the Titans is pointless, as mankind has never won a battle against them, Eren is dead set on joining the recon corps and fulfill his dream of one day to defeat all the Titans and see the world beyond the walls. On the day of graduation, Christa, Sasha, Conny Springer, Marco Bott, Jean, Eren, Annie, Bertholt, Reiner and Mikasa become the top ten recruits of their class. Despite the top ten are allowed to join the military police, Eren joins the recon force as he always intended, with Mikasa joining as well to watch over him. Armin, Sasha, Conny and some of the recruits follows their example and join the corps as well, after being inspired by Eren's speech to have mankind free of the Titans. They are assigned to Trost, one of the cities near Wall Rose, and are taken by surprise when the Colossal Titan appears before them, and just like it did years before, breaks through the gate, leaving the city unprotected. Once Eren regains his composure, he takes command and orders a counter attack as he climbs back to the top of the wall to have his revenge against the Titan.</div>

Ymir deduces that everyone else is dead due to the destruction around them. As Connie offers his help, Armin declines and make his way back to the rear guard. While maneuvering through the city he painfully accepts the reality of their world, likening it to hell and recalls that he tried to be strong so that he could walk the same path as Eren and Mikasa. He encounters Hannah trying to resuscitate a presumably dead Franz and bursts into tears at her hopeless struggle to save him. Meanwhile, the city's top merchant tries to force his cargo through the small evacuation gate and refuses to let anyone pass until his cargo is safe. As the crowd grows impatient due to panic, a lone Titan starts approaching at high speed from the rear, but is cut down at the last second by Mikasa. As she surveys the scene in front of the gate, she threatens the merchant, who yields and allows the citizens to pass through. Afterwards, as Mikasa has a word with her squad leader, she recalls the past incident in the year 844 when her family was murdered by a group of men who sought to sell her because of her Oriental blood lineage. As Dr. Jaeger and Eren discover the scene at Mikasa's former home, Dr. Jaeger orders Eren to return home. Although Eren disobeys and instead is able to track down the murderers to a nearby hut and kills two of them in an attempt to save Mikasa. When the third assailant shows up, he strangles Eren out of rage. Eren desperately convinces Mikasa to kill the man, which she does after she has the realization that their world is surrounded by death and if you don't fight, you'll die. In the aftermath, the Military Police show up and Dr. Jaeger scolds Eren for his reckless actions. As Mikasa laments that she has nowhere left to call home, she is invited by Dr. Jaeger and Eren to live with them, while the latter of whom gives Mikasa his red scarf. Back in the present, as the weather takes a turn for the worse, Mikasa slays more Titans and goes to help the other squads evacuate, while thoughts of Eren give her strength.</div>

Armin rescues Mikasa and they watch the rogue Titan defeat several other Titans with ease, showing that it somehow knows their weak point. Armin then gives all his gas and blades to Mikasa to allow her to keep going, as he keeps only a small blade for him to kill himself, rathering to commit suicide instead of being eaten alive, but she claims to him that she will not allow anyone else to die, inspired by the sight of the rogue Titan that saved her life.</div>

When Eren was eaten and swallowed by the Titan, he finds himself in its stomach along with bodies of its victims, some of whom are still alive. His anger over the Titans causes Eren to burst out of the Titan's stomach by transforming into a Titan himself and goes on a rampage against them. When Eren regains his consciousness, to his confusion, he, Armin, and Mikasa are surrounded by the Army who are aiming their weapons at him. It is revealed that after Mikasa and the others saw Eren emerge out of the Rogue Titan, they all agreed to keep it a secret and bring him back inside Wall Rose. However, Commander Kitz Weilman and his men did see it and has Eren cornered with Armin and Mikasa defending him. Kitz accuses Eren of being a Titan spy and demands to know what he is, but Eren has no idea since he has no memories of becoming a Titan or how his limbs grew back. Hoping to resolve the situation, Eren honestly answers he is human but a fearful Kitz orders the cannons to fire on them. As the three of them try to escape, Eren remembers his lost memories of his father giving him an injection, telling him to reclaim Wall Maria and go to their home's basement with his key. In order to protect Armin and Mikasa from the cannons, Eren transforms himself into the Rogue Titan.</div>

Commander Kitz is still afraid and once again orders the cannon to be loaded. Eren comes up with two plans of escape: the first is for him to transform into a Titan and run away on his own, forever criminalizing himself in the eyes of humanity; The second is to have Armin convince to Kitz that Eren is an asset, not a danger. Armin has several flashbacks and comes to the realization that even if he is a coward physically, he can still defend his friends mentally and decides to help talk their way out of being executed. Armin tentatively convinces Kitz, only to have him overcome by fear and give the order to fire once more. But the order is halted when Commander Pixis and his men intervene, sparing their lives. In return, Pixis asks Eren if he will transform himself and help block gap in the wall to prevent further Titan invasions. He agrees, regardless of whether or not he is able to control his Titan form.</div>

Claiming that Eren is the result of a secret project to turn humans into Titans, Pixis plans to have most of the troops gather at a far corner of Trost to lure most of the Titans away while Eren in Titan form carries the giant boulder needed to seal the hole. Along with Mikasa, Eren is accompanied by three of the best elites of the Garrison, Ian Dietrich, Rico Brzenska and Mitabi Jarnach. They will protect him during this mission. As they head toward the giant boulder, Rico reminds Eren that many lives are at stake for the sake of this mission. Finally reaching the boulder, Eren transforms himself into a Titan, but suddenly attacks Mikasa.</div>

The Military Police wants Eren killed as he is seen as an unknown threat and might cause a civil war while the Recon Corps wants to use his Titan powers to retake Wall Maria. As both sides get into arguments over Eren's Titan powers, one of the merchants siding with the Military Police accuses Mikasa as a Titan as well much to Eren's anger.

Despite Eren being brutally beaten, he does not change into a Titan which Levi shows to the court that the Recon Corps can control him and proposes that he is to be made part of his squad.

The recruits are later greeted by Erwin who tells them the Recon Corps' next expedition within a month is to reclaim Shiganshina and find the secret hidden in Eren's home basement. After telling the recruits of the Recon Corps' fatalities in each expedition, Erwin tells the recruits that they may stay and join them or leave to join the other branches. As many recruits leave, Jean joins the Recon Corps in honor of Marco with others joining him as well including Mikasa, Armin, Sasha, Connie, Ymir, Krista, Reiner, and Bertolt despite their fears. As the Recon Corps prepares themselves for the expedition, Eren is reunited with his friends and learns what happened to the others. Jean questions Eren if he can truly control his Titan powers as they are risking their lives for him. With everything ready, the Recon Corps begins their 57th Expedition.</div>

After Armin's squad manages to kill an Aberrant Titan, a female-looking Titan suddenly appears from the right flank in full speed. Much to Armin's shock, the Female Titan's body can withstand their blades and is intelligent enough to kill his seniors easily. The Female Titan captures Armin but after removing his hood and seeing his face, she leaves him alive and continues running. Armin is picked up by Reiner and Jean who reveals their right flank was destroyed by the Titans, which makes Armin realize it was the Female Titan's work and is possibly another Titan Shifter like Eren. When the three of them give conflicting sources on where Eren is, they realize the Female Titan's target is Eren and they must stop it. Despite their failed attempts to attack the Female Titan, it leaves them and Armin realizes it's now heading to where Eren is: the center of the group.</div>

Meanwhile, news reaches the center group about their right flank being annihilated by the Female Titan as the latter continues to wreak havoc within the formation. Soon the whole formation reaches the Forest of Giant Trees with only the center row entering it while the rest defend the forest from Titans. Eren realizes with alarm that nobody in his squad of the most elite soldiers comprehends Commander Erwin's orders, possibly not even Levi. They come face to face with the Female Titan as it chases them at their heels. The group desperately await Captain Levi's command to fall back onto their Maneuver Gears and attack the Titan, but Levi instead tells the group to cover their ears as he fires his flaregun.</div>

Eren tries to transform but is unable to which Mikasa suspects his feelings for Annie is preventing him. When another tunnel collapse traps Eren, Mikasa and Armin distract the Female Titan away from Eren.
